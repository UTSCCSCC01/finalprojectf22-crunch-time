### RANKD (https://rankd.ca/)
* A platform to connect you with other tennis players
* Our product is different because not only is our product for sports other than tennis, it reaches beyond even sports to cater to any particular “activity”
* Our product is better for…
  * Athletes besides tennis players who want a similar functionality to RANKD but for a different sport
  * Users who are non-athletes but still looking to find people of a common interest/activity
  * Our competitor likely didn’t expand their offering outside of the tennis community because they wanted to cater to a very niche area (tennis players only). The app is optimized solely for tennis players so switching to cover all of the other potential users of the app would require a large overhaul on the app and its software. 

### MeetMe (https://www.meetme.com/)
* A platform to make friends and meet new people. Functions sort of like a dating app, where you create a profile and others can find you based on keywords and tags in your profile before reaching out to you.
* Our product is different because we focus more on “groups” and events (sports, gaming) rather than meeting/matching with an individual person and asking them to do an activity with you. The end goal of our products are the same (meet new people for activities), but the way we go about it is what sets us apart. 
* Our product is better for…
  * People who want to quickly find a group or person for an activity. (ie. if you want to play a sport with someone that day, our product allows you to search, for example. “People looking for tennis matches today in my area”, rather than our competitor, where you’d have to search profiles mentioning “tennis” and then DM that person asking to play
  * Our competitor likely didn’t cater to the above user because they were focused more on finding and creating a long-term friendship as opposed to finding a quick connection for a specific activity (different product vision)

### Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/)
* A social media platform that allows users to connect with one another. Allows users to add friends, create posts showcasing their personal or professional life, as well as join groups to connect with people of common interests
* Our product is different because we are not coming to our audience as a social media platform. While there are similarities between Facebook and our product (namely the ability to join groups with people of similar interests), our product is designed specifically with that as the main focus, unlike Facebook whose guiding vision is allowing people to stay connected with friends and family as well as providing a means to express matters of importance. Hence, users of our product will likely have greater success in connecting with strangers for an activity than they would simply by using Facebook’s group feature as that is just a small part of Facebook’s overall purpose
* Our product is better for…
  * People who only want to use the product to find other people to connect with for a specific activity without having to go through all of the other necessary parts of creating and using a social media account. If someone has the specific goal of wanting to join a group/find people of common interests to interact with, our platform is superior to Facebook in this regard as that is the only functionality that our software provides as opposed to the multipurpose social media platform
  * Our competitor didn’t cater to the above because their vision was for a broader scope than ours. We are aiming to target just the demographic of people looking for others of common interests to partake in an activity with. Facebook’s vision was wider than that and catered to a larger number of people (and is why it is so big even today)

### Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/)
* Reddit is a chat forum platform that is used by people to share news and discuss topics of interest to them. The site is divided into portions or “subreddits” that each pertain to a specific activity/group/topic. There are many subreddits covering even the most niche of topics
* Our product is different because we aim to connect users for the purpose of doing an activity together (whether that be sports, gaming, etc.). While Reddit is similar in that it gives you a platform to chat and discuss a topic of common interest with people, its purpose is mainly just for discussion and not actually physically interacting or meeting people
* Our product is better for…
  * People looking to actually do an activity with someone. Reddit is a great place to *talk* about an activity but it’s not designed specifically for *doing*
  * Our competitor didn’t cater to the above because, similar to Facebook, the vision of the product was just different. Reddit’s goal was to give people a place to discuss topics and activities. Our product aims to give people a place to actually do those activities. This is a key difference in product vision and that is the biggest difference between us.
