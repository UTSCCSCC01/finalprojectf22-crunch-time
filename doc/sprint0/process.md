### Q:  How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?  
The team was organized using the “find a team member” thread on piazza. Further communication was done through email, and group members were invited to the group discord server for this project. Discord will be the main form of communication. In terms of tasks, we tried to ensure that each person had roughly two tasks, and accounted for other factors like size of tasks and preferences .

### Q: How did you make decisions?  
Decisions were made based on majority agreement (since we are 6, we re-vote if the votes were even), preference and convenience.  This included decisions regarding product idea, task assignment, and meeting times

### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate? 
Since we were a team of six, we would determine the priority of a user story based on the number of votes it got. Thus the max priority a story could be is 6, and the minimum is 0. 

### Q: How frequently did you meet?  
We met around every 3-4 days consisting of both in person and online meetings
### Q: What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
Increase the number of meetings to every 2-3 days, as the next phases will likely require more frequent discussion, especially when it comes to coding the website. 
Proper communication will be key in this project. Communicate more with the TA and Professor when it comes to any confusions or clarifications

Overall, the team worked effectively, efficiently, and communciation was thorough and clear. Also 
tasks were distributed evenly, and completed on time by all memebers
