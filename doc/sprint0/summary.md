### Project Objective
Our objective is to build a webapp that allows users to find people with similar interests as them to take part in hobbies 
together. The application helps users to find other people based on location and preferences.

### Key Users/Personas
1. Judy Smith - 28 year old journalist who likes to play basketball in her free time when she is not traveling.
2. Rory Lane - 30 years old freelance artist who is interested in a very niche board game.
3. Abdolreza Karimi - 19 years old university freshman studying abroad. He likes to play video games in his free time.

### Key Scenarios
1. Sam is an expert at tennis but struggles finding players at his level. He uses the website and 
sets his skill levels so that he can find other tennis players who are at a similar level as him.

2. Alex is new to town and doesnâ€™t know the area well. She wants to find people nearby who share the same interests as her and 
who she can participate in activities with. She would like to keep in contact with these people afterwards to help build her 
social network; therefore, she would like a feature to find 
friends within a distance of under 3 km so she can walk to meet up with them. 

3. Anthony recently discovered an interest in a new, niche video game, but he does not have anyone to play with. He would like to gather a group of people that he 
can play and chat with so he creates a group that people can join.


### Key Principles

Encouraging people to meet physically - groups, activities, tags on the app should provide plentiful opportunities for people 
to meet over their favorite sports and activities. Many other apps connect people virtually, but ours should connect physically as well.

Quality of connections over their quantity - our app should encourage people to meet like minded individuals who 
share their passions as deeply as they do. The friends you make on the app you should want to interact with often, not just occasionally.

Accessibility: Aim to design features and functionalities in accordance with standard accessibility guidelines so that the website is user 
friendly for various groups of individuals
